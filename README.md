**Cold Email Generator - Gen AI Project Using Llama3.1**

üöÄ **Overview**
This project demonstrates the process of building an end-to-end Gen AI application using Llama3.1, Langchain, Chromadb, and Streamlit. The goal of this tool is to help Software and AI services companies send cold emails to their potential clients with ease.

The system uses the Llama3.1 open-source language model, integrates with Chromadb (vector store), and utilizes Langchain for efficient job extraction and email generation. Finally, the Streamlit app serves as a user interface where users can generate professional cold emails from job postings.

üîß** Technologies Used**
Llama3.1: Open-source large language model.

Langchain: A framework to simplify building applications with LLMs.

Chromadb: A vector database to store and manage document embeddings.

Streamlit: A Python library for building beautiful, fast web apps for machine learning and data science.


**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**
Input URL: Enter the job posting URL where you want to generate a cold email.

Email Generation: The system scrapes the job posting using Llama3.1 and extracts necessary skills and details.

Portfolio Matching: It uses Langchain and Chromadb to search for matching portfolio links based on extracted skills.

Email: The generated email is displayed in the Streamlit UI, ready to be sent to the potential client.
